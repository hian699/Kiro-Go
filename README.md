Turn Kiro accounts into an OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible API service.

[English](README.md) | [中文](README_CN.md) | [Tiếng Việt](README_VI.md)

> This is an **enhanced fork** of the upstream Kiro-Go. It keeps full compatibility with the original endpoints and admin panel, and adds per-key rate limiting, a shared proxy pool with failover, model overrides, DoS protection, and a self-service usage dashboard. See [What's new vs. the original](#whats-new-vs-the-original).

## What it does

Kiro-Go is a reverse proxy. It manages a pool of Kiro accounts, translates incoming Claude/OpenAI requests into Kiro's upstream AWS format, streams responses back, and serves a web admin panel. It's a single Go module built on the standard library `net/http` — one dependency (`github.com/google/uuid`).

Request flow: **client → routing → auth → translator → pool picks account → stream from AWS → translate events back → client.**

## Features

- Anthropic `/v1/messages` and OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` (+ `/v1/responses`, `/v1/models`, `/v1/stats`)
- Multi-account pool with weighted round-robin load balancing and automatic failover
- Auto token refresh, SSE streaming, web admin panel
- Multiple auth methods: AWS Builder ID, IAM Identity Center (Enterprise SSO), Kiro Hosted SSO (incl. Microsoft Entra / external IdP), SSO token import, local Kiro credential cache, credentials JSON
- Usage tracking, account import/export, i18n (EN / 中文 / Tiếng Việt)
- Outbound proxy support (SOCKS5 / HTTP)
- Thinking mode (per-suffix or Claude `thinking` config)

## What's new vs. the original

Compared to the upstream Kiro-Go, this fork adds:

| Area | Feature |
|------|---------|
| **Per-key limits** | RPM limit (token-bucket delay, not hard error), concurrent-IP cap, IP allowlist (IP/CIDR), TPM display, per-key token/credit quota |
| **Friendly limit notice** | A configurable in-chat reply shown when a key is blocked (disabled / expired / over-limit / IP-denied) instead of a raw 401/429 |
| **Model overrides** | **Force Model** (global override for every request) and **per-key Model** — remap client-requested model names to a real upstream model without touching the client |
| **Identity model** | Tell the assistant to self-identify as a given model name without changing which upstream model actually serves the request |
| **Bound accounts** | Pin an API key to a fixed set of accounts (empty = shared pool) |
| **Lifetime counters** | Grand-total request/token/credit counters that survive a routine per-cycle "Reset Usage", plus "Reset All" |
| **Bulk key ops** | Bulk create / delete API keys, editable key values, JSON export (preserves External IdP metadata so Entra accounts re-import correctly) |
| **Shared proxy pool** | A pool of outbound proxies with persisted health and proxy-level failover — a dead proxy is skipped and retried after a cooldown, across restarts. Plus a **Require-proxy** safety toggle and per-request routing logs |
| **DoS protection** | App-layer guard (`proxy/dos_guard.go`): body-size cap, global concurrency limit, per-IP RPM reject, per-key inflight cap, trusted-proxy IP resolution — all tunable via env vars |
| **Admin hardening** | Brute-force throttle and session handling for the admin API |
| **Self-service usage** | A `/usage` dashboard where a key owner can view their own usage/logs, plus the `/check` portal |
| **Realtime UI** | The admin panel auto-refreshes lists (accounts, keys) without a manual reload |

## Quick start

### Windows (local, one-click)

```bat
run.bat
```

`run.bat` stops any previous instance, finds a free port, builds, and runs. Requires [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) installed and an existing `data/config.json`.

### Build from source

```bash
go build -o kiro-go .
./kiro-go
```

Config is auto-created at `data/config.json` if missing. Open <http://localhost:8080/admin>.

### Docker Compose (recommended for servers)

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Use `--build` whenever the code changes, otherwise compose reuses a stale cached image. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for the full Docker guide, including the SSO loopback-port mechanism.

The default admin password is `changeme` — override it via the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var or change it in the admin panel before going to production.

## Usage

Open `http://localhost:8080/admin`, log in, add accounts, then call the API:

```bash
# Claude
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -d '{"model":"claude-sonnet-4.5","max_tokens":1024,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}]}'

# OpenAI
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-your-key" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4o","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}]}'
```

When any API key is enabled, requests must carry a valid key (`Authorization: Bearer sk-...`).

### Endpoints

| Type | Paths |
|------|-------|
| API (key-gated) | `/v1/messages`, `/v1/messages/count_tokens`, `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`, `/v1/models`, `/v1/stats` |
| Self-service (caller's own key) | `/v1/key/info`, `/v1/key/logs`, `/usage` |
| Admin | `/admin` (page), `/admin/api/*` (password-gated) |
| Public | `/health`, `/check` |

### Model overrides & identity

- **Force Model** (Settings → Force Model): overrides the model of *every* request. Use it when a client asks for a model name that doesn't exist upstream (e.g. remap `claude-sonnet-4.8` → a real model) to avoid 503s.
- **Per-key Model** (API-key modal): same idea, scoped to one key. Force Model takes precedence.
- **Identity Model**: only changes how the assistant answers "what model are you?" — it does not change the upstream model.

### Thinking mode

Append a suffix (default `-thinking`) to the model name, e.g. `claude-sonnet-4.5-thinking`. Claude requests with a top-level `thinking` config (`{"type":"enabled","budget_tokens":2048}` or `{"type":"adaptive"}`) also enable it. Output format is configurable in Settings → Thinking Mode.

### Outbound proxy

Configure in Settings → Outbound Proxy. Supports SOCKS5 and HTTP. This fork adds a **shared proxy pool** with health tracking and failover, and a **Require-proxy** toggle that blocks outbound Kiro requests if no proxy is available (prevents leaking the server's real IP). Changes take effect immediately without a restart.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `CONFIG_PATH` | Config file path | `data/config.json` |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Admin panel password (overrides config at startup) | - |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `debug` / `info` / `warn` / `error` | `info` |
| `LOOPBACK_HOST` | Host to bind the SSO loopback server. **Set to `0.0.0.0` in Docker.** | `127.0.0.1` |
| `KIRO_MAX_BODY_BYTES` | Max request body size (`0` = disable) | `10485760` (10 MiB) |
| `KIRO_MAX_CONCURRENT` | Global concurrent-request cap | `256` |
| `KIRO_IP_RPM` | Requests/minute/IP before reject | `120` |
| `KIRO_PER_KEY_INFLIGHT` | Concurrent RPM-delayed requests per key before 429 | `8` |
| `KIRO_TRUST_PROXY` | Read the real client IP from `X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Real-IP`. Only enable behind a trusted reverse proxy. | `false` |

## Troubleshooting

**`Refusing to start: admin password is still the default on a non-loopback host`.** This is a deliberate safety guard: the app won't boot when the admin password is still `changeme` **and** the host is not loopback (e.g. `0.0.0.0`). Two fixes: for local use, set `"host": "127.0.0.1"` in `data/config.json` (you can keep `changeme`); for a public/Docker deploy, set a strong `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var instead. Never expose `0.0.0.0` with the default password.

**"All loopback ports busy" / Start Login returns HTTP 500.** Usually a bad `LOOPBACK_HOST` (e.g. `0.0.0` missing an octet). In Docker, it must be exactly `0.0.0.0`. Check with `docker compose exec kiro-go printenv LOOPBACK_HOST`, fix the compose file, then `docker compose up -d --force-recreate` (env is baked at container creation). Starting a new login also cancels pending sessions to free leaked loopback ports.

**App runs an old version after a code change.** `docker compose up` won't rebuild a cached image. Run `docker compose up -d --build`.

**Compose fails on port `49153`/`5015x` ("address already in use") on macOS.** Those ports are in the OS ephemeral range. They're unnecessary — only the low SSO ports (3128–9091) are needed. Remove the `49153`–`53153` mappings.

**Getting 503 on a specific model.** The client is likely requesting a model that doesn't exist upstream. Use Force Model or per-key Model to remap it to a real one.

**Per-IP rate limits look wrong behind a proxy.** If you run Nginx/Cloudflare in front, set `KIRO_TRUST_PROXY=true` — otherwise every request looks like it comes from `127.0.0.1`. If you're exposing Go directly, keep it `false`, or attackers can spoof `X-Forwarded-For`. See [deploy/HARDENING.md](deploy/HARDENING.md).

**Lost config / accounts after a crash.** Config lives in `data/config.json`; mount `/app/data` as a volume so it survives container recreation. Always run behind the `./data` volume in `docker-compose.yml`.

For production DoS/DDoS hardening (Cloudflare + Nginx + fail2ban), see [deploy/HARDENING.md](deploy/HARDENING.md).
